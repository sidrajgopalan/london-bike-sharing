## London Bike Sharing Visualisation

This analysis is part of the course ST445 (Managing and Visualising Data) at the London School of Economics. This project was inspired by Todd Schneider's analysis of bike sharing data in New York. Bike sharing has taken off in a number of cities around the world and contributes greatly to reducing environment impact and improving liveability in cities. Understanding how users engage with the system can help to improve the system's efficiency and user-friendliness.

The aim of the project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on the London bike sharing open dataset.
